# Oxford Physics Summer School - Quantum Computing Projects (july-aug 2025)

This repository contains the projects completed throughout the **Oxford Physics Summer School - Year 12 Quantum Experience**. Each day, new quantum-mechanics topics were explored and developed to reach a final goal of --- ---, which was explored initially through maths, and then generalised with python programming.

### Day 1 - Review of prior knowledge and Kronecker product
- Here I learned the basis of the Kronecker product and representing qubits in vector form.
- This was then implemented into a python program
