# Oxford Physics Summer School - Quantum Computing Projects (Jul-Aug 2025)

This repository contains the projects completed throughout the **Oxford Physics Summer School - Year 12 Quantum Experience**. Each day, new quantum-mechanics topics were explored and developed to reach a final goal of modelling spin-field interactions in simple structures, which was explored initially through maths, and then generalised with python programming. This was completed with WilliamMartin1000 see https://github.com/WilliamMartin1000.

### Day 1 - Review of Prior Knowledge and the Kronecker Product
- Here I learned the basis of the Kronecker product and representing qubits in vector form.
- This was then implemented into a python program.

### Day 2 - Introduction to the Hamiltonian
- I created a python programme to build the Hamiltonian for electron spin (1/2) in a magnetic field at angle $\theta$; calculating eigenvalues for varying magnetic field strength.
- Here I deduced that the target frequency of 9.7 GHz occurs at around 0.35 T, this was done through the differences of eigenvalues at different magnetic field strengths.

### Day 3 - Qiskit and Developing the Hamiltonian
- I explored the qiskit library exploring ket positions on the bloch sphere, and finding the axis-of-rotation for the Hadamard gate (eigenvectors), demonstrating this on the bloch sphere.
- I developed the previous electron Hamiltonian to include a nucleus, the Hamiltonian including the Electron Zeeman, the Nuclear Zeeman and the Hyperfine interaction.
- The previous then further developed to have another electron, introducing magnetic anistropy. Upon data analysis anticrossing was noticed but out of range for the project.

### Day 4 - Tours of Relevant Companies
- Oxford Ionics: Here I saw the labs where quantum computing systems were developed, being shown a variety of ionic quantum computers and was taught how they worked.
- ISIS Neutron and Muon Source: I got a general tour around the building seeing the synchrotron as well as neutron imaging machines.
- NQCC: I got show the national quantum computing centre where tests surrounding quantum computers were done.
- Oxford Instruments: I was shown around being taught about the refidgerant systems used to cool down quantum computers to the milli-Kelvin range.

### Day 5 - Poster Creation, Presentation and Interview Panel
- Over a couple of hours we created a poster covering our research for the week. This was the later presented to the cohort, supervisors, and others present.
- We also had discussions with professionals in the subject exploring future possible career paths and annulling any outstanding questions.
