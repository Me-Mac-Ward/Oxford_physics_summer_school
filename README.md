# Oxford Physics Summer School - Quantum Computing Projects (july-aug 2025)

This repository contains the projects completed throughout the **Oxford Physics Summer School - Year 12 Quantum Experience**. Each day, new quantum-mechanics topics were explored and developed to reach a final goal of --- ---, which was explored initially through maths, and then generalised with python programming. This was completed with WilliamMartin1000 see https://github.com/WilliamMartin1000.

### Day 1 - Review of Prior Knowledge and the Kronecker Product
- Here I learned the basis of the Kronecker product and representing qubits in vector form.
- This was then implemented into a python program.

### Day 2 - Introduction to the Hamiltonian
- I created a python programme to build the Hamiltonian for electron spin (1/2) in a magnetic field at angle $\theta$; calculating eigenvalues for varying magnetic field strength.
- Here I deduced that the target frequency of 9.7 GHz occurs at around 0.35 T, this was done through the differences of eigenvalues at different magnetic field strengths.

### Day 3 - Qiskit and Developing the Hamiltonian
- I explored the qiskit library exploring ket positions on the bloch sphere, and finding the axis-of-rotation for the Hadamard gate (eigenvectors), demonstrating this on the bloch sphere.
- I developed the previous electron Hamiltonian to include a nucleus, the Hamiltonian including the Electron Zeeman, the Nuclear Zeeman and the Hyperfine interaction.
- The previous then further developed to have another electron, introducing magnetic anistropy. Upon data analysis anticrossing was noticed but out of range for the project.
